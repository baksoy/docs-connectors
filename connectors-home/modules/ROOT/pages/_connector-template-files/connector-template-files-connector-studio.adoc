Set connector-specific values for the following variables:

* {exchange-search-name} - Lower case term used to find the connector in Exchange. For example, redis.
* {lc-connector-name} - Lower case connector name to use in the namespace code and POM file. For example: redis.
* {connector-name} - Name of the connector without the word "Connector." For example, Redis.
* {version} - connector version. For example, 1.0.

You can configure one of these sources to use with {connector-name} Connector:

If the connector has connector-specific input sources, list them first, using one bullet for each input source. If the connector has only one source, do not use a list.
////

Use one input source as an example. If the connector has a connector-specific input source, use one of those input sources as an example. In the example, list the required and important fields.  If the connector does not have a connector-specific input source, use HTTP Listener, using the partial shown below.

To configure the global element for <Connector name> Connector, follow these steps:

. In the *General* tab, in *Connection*, select the authentication method to configure:
* <link to authentication method config section>
* <link to authentication method config section>
//The wording of step 3 depends on how many authentication methods the connector uses. If the connector uses only one authentication method, mention it in step 3 and then explain how to configure it in this procedure. If the connector uses multiple authentication methods, mention them in step 3 and then refer to subsections that explain how to configure the authentication methods.

[[basic_authentication]]
=== Basic Authentication

Enter the following information in the *General* tab of the *Global Element Properties* screen to configure Basic authentication:

[%header,cols=30s,70a]
|===
|Field |User Action
|Name |Enter the configuration name.
|Connection | Select *Basic*.
|Session Token | Optionally enter the session token provided by Amazon Security Token Service (STS).
|Access Key | Enter the access key provided by Amazon.
|Secret Key | Enter the secret key provided by Amazon.
|Try Default AWS Credentials Provider Chain | Set to `true` to obtain credentials from the AWS environment.
|Region Endpoint | Select the region endpoint for the service.
|===

The following image shows an example of configuring Basic authentication:

image::<image>.png[*Basic* is selected in the *Connection* section and authentication fields are completed in the *General* tab.]

The first item shows where to specify that the connector uses Basic authentication. The second item shows the *General* tab, which contains fields related to Basic authentication.

Example of wording for Role authentication (this example is for Amazon connectors only)

[[role-authentication]]
=== Role Authentication

Enter the following information on the *General* tab of the global element configuration screen to configure Role authentication:

[%header,cols=30s,70a]
|===
|Field |User Action
|Name |Enter the configuration name.
|Connection | Select `Role`.
|Role ARN | Enter the role to assume to gain cross-account access.
