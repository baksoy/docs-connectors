* {connector-name} - Name of the connector without the word "Connector." For example, Redis.
* {version} - connector version. For example, 1.0.

You can configure one of these sources to use with {connector-name} Connector:

////
If the connector has connector-specific input sources, list them first, using one bullet for each input source. If the connector has only one source, do not use a list.
////

* *Subscribe*

include::connectors::partial$t-studio-partial.adoc[tags=listener-scheduler-descriptions]

////
Use one input source as an example. If the connector has a connector-specific input source, use one of those input sources as an example. In the example, list the required and important fields.  If the connector does not have a connector-specific input source, use HTTP Listener, using the partial shown below.
